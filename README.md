## ðŸ‘‹ Introduction
**GPlaces** provides programmatic access to Google's database of local place and business information, as well as the device's current place.

It uses the [Places SDK for Android](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/android-sdk/overview) API on Android and the [Places SDK for iOS](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/ios-sdk/overview) on iOS.

## âš¡ Features
Help your customers explore where they are and whatâ€™s around them:

* **Place Autocomplete** automatically fills in the name and/or address of a place as users type.
* **Current Place** returns a list of places where the userâ€™s device is last known to be located along with an indication of the relative likelihood for each place.
* **Place Details** return and display more detailed information about a place.
* **Place Photos** returns high-quality images of a place.
